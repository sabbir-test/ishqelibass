# Admin Products Feature Implementation

## Summary
I have successfully implemented the "Add Product" functionality in the admin section that was missing. The implementation includes:

### 1. Admin Products Page (`/admin/products`)
Created a comprehensive admin products management page with the following features:

#### Key Features:
- **Product Listing**: Display all products in a responsive grid layout
- **Add New Products**: Form to create new products with all required fields
- **Edit Products**: Edit existing product information
- **Delete Products**: Remove products with confirmation dialog
- **Search & Filter**: Search products by name/description and filter by category
- **Product Status Indicators**: Show featured products, discounts, and stock status
- **Image Handling**: Support for multiple product images stored as JSON

#### Product Information Displayed:
- Product image (with fallback to placeholder)
- Product name and description
- Category name
- SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
- Price with discount calculation
- Stock quantity with low stock warnings
- Featured product badge
- Active/inactive status

### 2. API Endpoints
Created/Enhanced API endpoints for product management:

#### Existing API (`/api/admin/products/route.ts`)
- **GET**: List products with pagination, search, and category filtering
- **POST**: Create new products

#### New API (`/api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts`)
- **PUT**: Update existing product
- **DELETE**: Delete product

### 3. Database Schema
The implementation uses the existing Prisma schema with the following product fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Product name
- `description`: Product description
- `price`: Original price
- `discount`: Discount percentage
- `finalPrice`: Calculated final price
- `stock`: Available quantity
- `sku`: Unique stock keeping unit
- `images`: JSON array of image URLs
- `categoryId`: Reference to category
- `isFeatured`: Featured product flag
- `isActive`: Product status
- `createdAt/updatedAt`: Timestamps

### 4. Admin Dashboard Integration
Updated the admin dashboard to link the "Add Product" button to the new products management page.

## How to Use

### Adding a New Product:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
2. Click "Add Product" button
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - Product Name *

4. Click "Add Product" to save

### Managing Existing Products:
1. Go to `/admin/products`
2. Use search and filters to find products
3. Click "Edit" to modify product details

```
